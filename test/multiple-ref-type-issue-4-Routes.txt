= Test file for issue #4 - multiple appearance of "ref;type" value for different lines in different areas

- We test with 4 expected bus routes, all having "A" as the 'ref'
-
- Two of them have identical 'operator' but different 'from' and 'to'

== Bus 'A' in Annaberg-Buchholz: Barbara-Uthmann-Ring => Buchholz, operated by Operator RVE
A;bus;Bus A fährt in Annaberg-Buchholz;Barbara-Uthmann-Ring;Buchholz;RVE

== Bus 'A' in Aue: Postplatz => Postplatz, operated also by Operator RVE but different 'from' and 'to'
A;bus;Bus A fährt in Aue;Postplatz;Postplatz;RVE

== Bus 'A' in Burgstädt: Sportzentrum => Heiersdorf, operated by Operator RBM
A;bus;Bus A fährt in Burgstädt;Sportzentrum;Heiersdorf;RBM

== Missing Bus 'A' in XYZ: Platz1 => Platz2, operated by Operator ABC
A;bus;Bus A fährt in XYZ;Platz1;Platz2;ABC
