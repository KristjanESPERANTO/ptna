# Headers start with '=', '==', '===', '====', ... at the beginning of a line

# Simple text starts with '-' at the beginning of a line.
#    Simple text starts may only be placed directly after a header line.
#    A single '-' at the beginning of a line, followed by nothing:
#    - if there was simple text before, it creates a line feed (i.e. encloses the text in a paragraph <p> ... </p>)
#    - if there was no simple text before or a line feed, it creates an empty line (i.e. <p>&amp;nbsp;</p>)

# !!!Text yellow background!!! in simple text or headers
# '''''Text mit bold and italics''''' in simple text or headers
# '''Text with bold chars''' in simple text or headers
